Things I learend in the school of hard knocks

 - You will create dynamic-web-application in intellij, using jakarta. If you use jakarta and tomcat, you always need tomcat verison >= 10
 - Also observe mapping we did in web.xml, servlet name should match with the value in HelloServlet.java
 - Don't try to change basePath atleast for few attempts. If you want to change, do some research.
